# Challenge: VBA Refractor Code
Steve's parents are focused on a single renewable energy stock (DAQO, or DQ). He would like them to expand their horizons. This work employs Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)  coding to create an automated review (a macros) of the returns for 11 additional stocks. The final performance provided sufficient information, but time is money. The next step of the process was to improve macros productivity for the days when Steve wants to review additional stocks. The following demonstrates how the original code was modified to increase macros efficiency.

### Project Overview
With provided code, a macros was developed to analyze the return for the stock of interest, DQ. After using Range() and Cells() to create necessary headers in a new worksheet, variables were created for stock starting and ending prices, as well as the individual stock ticker symbols. For loops and conditionals were used to pull stock-specific information from 2018 data and populate the new worksheet. Cells were formated to highlight returns that were both positive (green) and negative (red). The information was further refined to allow more flexible use. Initializing the code with pop-up question, the user is able to select the year of interest. A BUTTON ... REST OF STUFF ...
