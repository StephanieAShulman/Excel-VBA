# Challenge: VBA Refractor Code

## Project Overview
While Steve's parents are focused on a single renewable energy stock (DAQO, or DQ), he would like them to expand their horizons. This work employs Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro coding to create an automated review of the returns for 11 additional stocks. The final performance provided sufficient information, but - as with anything - time is money, and the next step of the process was to improve macros efficiency. The following demonstrates how the original code was modify to increase productivity.
   ### Initial Approach
   With provided code, a macro was developed to analyze the return for the stock of interest, DQ. After using Range() and Cells() to create necessary headers in a new worksheet, variables were created for stock starting and ending prices, as well as the individual stock ticker symbols. For loops and conditionals were used to pull stock-specific information from 2018 data and populate the new worksheet. Cells were formated to highlight returns that were both positive (green) and negative (red). The information was further refined to allow more flexible use. Initializing the code with pop-up question, the user is able to select the year of interest. A BUTTON ... REST OF STUFF ... 
   
   
   
      Create a VBA macro that can trigger pop-ups and inputs, read and change cell values, and format cells.
Use for loops and conditionals to direct logic flow.
Use nested for loops.
Apply coding skills such as syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging.
